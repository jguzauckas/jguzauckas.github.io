<p>I just figured out TeX integration, so now I can write $y = mx + b$</p>

<p>I love math but have always been interested in the trades. Fortunately, mathematics has me covered:</p>
<blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plumbing_(mathematics)">
    In the mathematical field of geometric topology, among the techniques known as surgery theory, the process of <b>plumbing</b> is a way to create new manifolds out of disk bundles. It was first described by John Milnor[1] and subsequently used extensively in surgery theory to produce manifolds and normal maps with given surgery obstructions.
